# About me

👋 Hi there! I'm Vinay Khanchi, a passionate software developer proficient in Java, Rust, and Python. With a solid foundation in microservices architecture and a background steeped in startup culture, I thrive in dynamic and fast-paced environments.

🎓 I earned my bachelor's degree from MSIT, where I honed my skills and developed a deep understanding of software engineering principles.

💼 My experience extends to crafting robust and scalable solutions in various domains, with a particular focus on building microservices-based applications to drive innovation and efficiency.

💹 Beyond coding, I have a keen interest in trading and leveraging automation to optimize trading strategies. I love exploring the intersection of technology and finance, seeking out ways to automate and optimize trading processes.

🏏 Outside of the tech realm, you might find me on the cricket field, where I've competed at the state level. I thrive on the camaraderie and strategic thinking that the sport demands.

🌍 When I'm not coding or playing cricket, I'm likely out seeking new adventures. Whether it's hiking through scenic trails, embarking on road trips, or trying out adrenaline-pumping activities, I'm always up for a new challenge.

🚀 Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects! Feel free to reach out and explore opportunities to innovate together
